# Home Ops :house:

Tools and configuration to maintain home networks and devices.

## Processes and Techniques

This repository contains [Up](README-UP.md), a custom systems automation
utility focusing on security and performance. It offers familiar syntax
that is hopefully similar to Ansible, but doesn't attempt full
compatibility.

Up defines several different methods for executing tasks (and testing
whether they need to be run at all). For details, [take a look at the
documentation](README-UP.md).

## Developing

* Attempt to test each revision as thoroughly as possible, in all of the
  above environments (and if you can't, mention why).

* Please fork if configuration from this repository doesn't meet your
  needs. PRs will be accepted within reason, but the plan is to keep it
  lean and tightly focused on my needs as an engineer and multimedia
  producer.
